# Python Basics

This project is designed to teach you the basics of Python programming. It covers various fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, operators, data structures, control flow, functions, and modules.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories: `src` and `tests`.

- `src`: This directory contains Python scripts that explain various Python concepts.
  - `basics.py`: Introduces basic Python syntax and concepts.
  - `data_structures.py`: Explains Python's built-in data structures.
  - `control_flow.py`: Covers control flow tools in Python.
  - `functions.py`: Teaches how to define and use functions in Python.
  - `modules.py`: Explains how to import and use modules in Python.

- `tests`: This directory contains unit tests for the Python scripts in the `src` directory.
  - `test_basics.py`: Contains unit tests for `basics.py`.
  - `test_data_structures.py`: Contains unit tests for `data_structures.py`.
  - `test_control_flow.py`: Contains unit tests for `control_flow.py`.
  - `test_functions.py`: Contains unit tests for `functions.py`.
  - `test_modules.py`: Contains unit tests for `modules.py`.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python scripts in the `src` directory to learn various Python concepts. For example, to run `basics.py`, use the following command:

```bash
python src/basics.py
```

4. Run the unit tests in the `tests` directory to test your understanding of the concepts. For example, to run `test_basics.py`, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_basics.py
```
